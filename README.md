# SQL Analytics with HIVE
> I built this project as a part of my big data learning journey. 
The aim of this project is to deep dive into advanced features in Hive that allows us to run SQL based analytical queries 
over large datasets  

The source is a sample MySQL database 'Adventure works'. We will ingest and transform the data before we proceed to analytics</br> 
Download the sample db script here - https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases
